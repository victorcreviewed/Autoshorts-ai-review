## My User Experience:

Within my weeks of testing, I woke up one morning to find three polished, faceless videos published on my TikTok and YouTube channels—AutoShorts.ai had taken my simple “Productivity Hacks” prompt, generated AI-driven scenes, voiceovers, and subtitles, then scheduled and posted them while I slept . The setup was shockingly smooth: after linking my accounts and choosing a plan, the platform’s “auto-pilot” scheduling saved me from manual uploads and freed hours each week. I even experimented with Spanish subtitles, and by the next morning my comment section was buzzing with international viewers—proof that one-click translation into multiple languages really works. Of course, the rigid 30–90-second duration and limited clip-level tweaks meant I sometimes had to resort to external editors for final pacing, but overall the time savings and consistent output felt nothing short of magical. In just a few clicks, I traded hours of editing for strategic brainstorming—AutoShorts.ai became my silent, behind-the-scenes creative partner
